# Movie Search App
## Description

 In this web-application, users can search Movies by their name and can also get their detailed information from IMDb Website. I've used OMDB API to fetch the movies data. You can search a movie in the search bar and if results match then you will get the related movies else you will get an error message. 

Check it out [here](https://search-movie12.herokuapp.com/).
